# Master thesis - Heart Stroke Predictor

## Introduction

Nowadays cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally. In particular, [isquemic heart or stroke](https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death#what-do-people-die-from) remained the leading causes of death globally in the last 15 years. In addition, it is very hard to anticipate a stroke episode and usually when it is detected, it is too late for a treatment, resulting in severe problems or death.

To anticipate a stroke in advance, heart electrophysiological indicators or arrythmia information might be very useful. For example, a very good indicator of a potential stroke could be a patient with [atrial fibrilation](https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/atrial_fibrillation.htm), since it is the most common arrythmia and seems to be related to a stroke over time. However, to detect and treat these kind of arrythmias one needs an experienced specialist, dedicated technology and attention, which unfortunately, cannot be guaranteed for this really demanding disease. 

Here is where data plays a very important role and offers a very good opportunity to better understand and predict strokes. This would be a realy big step in the healthcare world, allowing anticipated patient treatments and saving an uncountable amount of lives.

In this project I have worked to answer the following question: 

#### Based on simple patient paramenters, is this patient going to have a stroke?

## Data description

will explain the different files and show how to run the heart prediction user interface, which uses a classification model to predict strokes:


## Methodology
machine learning techniques used, statistical methodologies

stroke_exploring_data.ipynb - code for cleaning the dataset and explore the data already cleaned, see first graphs and relationship between features
stroke_data_for_modeling.csv - code to model the data and perform Machine Learning model analysis
stroke_predictor_models.ipynb - code with the best possible model to predict heart stroke

## Summary of main results
The most important features to predict a heart stroke are systolic pressure, weigth and cholesterol

## Conclusions
Not a summary of the work. The problem was relevant, now with your work, what can you say about how the problem is solved?
